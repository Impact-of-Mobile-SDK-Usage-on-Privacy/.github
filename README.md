## Contents

During our research, we developed ten Android and iOS applications utilizing 5 different analytics and advertising SDKs.
We measured the traffic of those default implementations using the [scala-appanalyzer]() and analyzed the collected traffic using the [scala-plotalyzed]().
Both tools are constantly developed and managed using [their own org]().
For instructions on how to conduct measurements and analysis using the tools refer to that org.

As our artifact this repository contains the [measurement]() and [analysis]() specific plugins as well as the code of our sample applications in separate repositories for the differen SDKs and OS.
